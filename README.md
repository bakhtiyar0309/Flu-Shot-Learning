# Flu-Shot-Learning

**Can you predict whether people got H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines using information they shared about their backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors?**

In this challenge, we will take a look at vaccination, a key public health measure used to fight infectious diseases. Vaccines provide immunization for individuals, and enough immunization in a community can further reduce the spread of diseases through "herd immunity."


## Problem Description 

Your goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Specifically, you'll be predicting two probabilities: one for `h1n1_vaccine` and one for `seasonal_vaccine`.

Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.
